Review Questions from Chapter 3 of The Art and Science of Java
by Eric S. Roberts


1. A data type is defined by a domain and a set of operations. A domain being
the set of values that a data type could be, and the set of operations are the
tools available to manipulate that data type.

2. All are legal constants with the exception of (2 + 3), 1,000,000, and
1.1X+11. You cant use commas when dealing with numeric data in Java. and the 'X'
is a variable and therefore not a constant.
	42 int, -17 int, -2.3 double, 20 int, 2.0 double, 3.1415926 double,
123456789 int, 	0.00001 double, 1.1E11 double
	
3.	(a) 6.02252E+23 (b) 2.997925E+10 (c) 5.29167E-9 (d) 3.1415926535E+0

4.	a-legal b-legal c-legal d-illegal e-illegal f-legal g-illegal h-legal
i-illegal j-illegal k-legal l-legal

5.	(a) 5 int  (b) 3 int (c) 3.8 double (d) 18 double (e) 4 int (f) 2 int

8. k = (int) 3.14 would contain a 3, same with k = 2.7182 containing a 2 since
the value 	becomes truncated and no remainder or rounding takes place

9.	To specify conversion between types you utilize a type cast. For example 
2 + (double) 3 would evaluate to 5.0 not just 5

10.	cellCount *=2

11.	x++

12.	A boolean value can either be true or false

13.	Hopefully and usually Java when compiling the program will alarm for an
error, but essentially it is trying to set something as a variable rather than
compare the two values.

14.	n>=0 && n<10

15.	In english the expression is asking if x is any integer besides 4 OR is x
any integer thats not 17. It would evaluate to true always because even if X was
4 it would be true because of the 2nd half of the equation and because of short
circuit evaluation if X was seventeen it would meet the first half of the
expression and not worry about the 2nd half since it is an OR comparative.

16. See above

17.	Named constants makes programs not only much easier to read by another
programmer but much easier to change in the future and adapt to unknown
circumstances.

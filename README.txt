	I am using the book The Art and Science of Java by Eric Roberts to dive
into computer science. In this Repository I will be posting my responses to
the review questions at the end of each chapter as well as any code I write
as part of the exercises in the book.

	This is not meant to be a study guide and there is no guarantee of correctness,
but merely a way to track my progress, and practice using git, GitHub, Java, and
other tools.

	When possible, the answers will be worded in a way that will hopefully
contextually express what the question was. Extremely basic questions are left
out, as this is not an exercise in my typing, but rather a tool to track my
progress and a way to help me fully understand the material
